Short interpreter I wrote for brainfuck on a whim, uploading here to share with some people
Currently the file i/o does not work, and I do not care to fix it so that section is commented out
Executes the brainfuck instructions in source, then prints out what the instructions were 
To use, download the C file, compile it using your preferred compiler, then run it in a terminal
Currently the brainfuck file it has in it just prints out hello world, the code for which is sourced from https://hackage.haskell.org/package/oplang-0.4.0.1/candidate/src/examples/hello-world.bf
